# Uuups documentation

[Uuups](https://github.com/samikeijonen/uuups) is a starter theme and an experiment how to bring your theme to the next level.

## Documentation in Github

[Uuups documentation](https://github.com/samikeijonen/uuups-docs) is also available in the Github.

## Read Mythic documentation

This is my playground from [Justin Tadlock's starter theme called Mythic](https://github.com/justintadlock/mythic). Most of the code is the same
but I have small experiments here and there.

[Mythic Wiki](https://github.com/justintadlock/mythic/wiki) have lot's of
relevant information. Make sure to check it out.
